# Pred_prey_sim
# ver 4.0
# By Tom Weston

This is a Cellular Automata system that attempts to simulate the predator-prey interactions seen in the Lotka-Volterra model.

To run, open the file "pred_prey_sim" using processing and press run.

By default it saves an Octave script of results after 500 generations, this can be changed under the draw() function.

To produce visual data from this script, open the directory in Octave and type 'run("ver_4_results.m")'.

This project is a work in progress.
